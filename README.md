Both the original and processed data are collected stored in the Data folder, with the preprocessing code to obtain the corresponding static hypergraphs.
# Code

The code used to simulate the Naming-Game (NG) process on hypergraphs with committed minority is available at [https://github.com/iaciac/higher-order-NG](https://github.com/iaciac/higher-order-NG)

The code use the CompleX Group Interactions (XGI) library in Python [https://xgi.readthedocs.io](https://xgi.readthedocs.io/)
